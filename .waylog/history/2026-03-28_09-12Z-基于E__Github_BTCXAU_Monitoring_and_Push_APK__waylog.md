<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted. Network access is enabled.
Approval policy is currently never. Do not provide the `sandbox_permissions` for any reason, commands will be rejected.
</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

The `request_user_input` tool is unavailable in Default mode. If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.

## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- doc: Use when the task involves reading, creating, or editing `.docx` documents, especially when formatting or layout fidelity matters; prefer `python-docx` plus the bundled `scripts/render_docx.py` for visual checks. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/doc/SKILL.md)
- figma: Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma/SKILL.md)
- figma-code-connect-components: Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md)
- figma-create-design-system-rules: Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md)
- figma-create-new-file: Create a new blank Figma file. Use when the user wants to create a new Figma design or FigJam file, or when you need a new file before calling use_figma. Handles plan resolution via whoami if needed. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard) (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-create-new-file/SKILL.md)
- figma-generate-design: Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, screen, or view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles via search_design_system, imports them, and assembles screens incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-generate-design/SKILL.md)
- figma-generate-library: Build or update a professional-grade design system in Figma from a codebase. Use when the user wants to create variables/tokens, build component libraries, set up theming (light/dark modes), document foundations, or reconcile gaps between code and Figma. This skill teaches WHAT to build and in WHAT ORDER — it complements the `figma-use` skill which teaches HOW to call the Plugin API. Both skills should be loaded together. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-generate-library/SKILL.md)
- figma-implement-design: Translates Figma designs into production-ready application code with 1:1 visual fidelity. Use when implementing UI code from Figma files, when user mentions "implement design", "generate code", "implement component", provides Figma URLs, or asks to build components matching Figma specs. For Figma canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-implement-design/SKILL.md)
- figma-use: **MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-use/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-code-connect-components: Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-create-design-system-rules: Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-create-new-file: Create a new blank Figma file. Use when the user wants to create a new Figma design or FigJam file, or when you need a new file before calling use_figma. Handles plan resolution via whoami if needed. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard) (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-create-new-file/SKILL.md)

- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that can...", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)
- frontend-skill: Use when the task asks for a visually strong landing page, website, app, prototype, demo, or game UI. This skill enforces restrained composition, image-led hierarchy, cohesive content structure, and tasteful motion while avoiding generic cards, weak branding, and UI clutter. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/frontend-skill/SKILL.md)
- github:gh-address-comments: Address actionable GitHub pull request review feedback. Use when the user wants to inspect unresolved review threads, requested changes, or inline review comments on a PR, then implement selected fixes. Use the GitHub app for PR metadata and flat comment reads, and use the bundled GraphQL script via `gh` whenever thread-level state, resolution status, or inline review context matters. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md)
- github:gh-fix-ci: Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions. Use the GitHub app from this plugin for PR metadata and patch context, and use `gh` for Actions check and log inspection before implementing any approved fix. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md)
- github:github: Triage and orient GitHub repository, pull request, and issue work through the connected GitHub app. Use when the user asks for general GitHub help, wants PR or issue summaries, or needs repository context before choosing a more specific GitHub workflow. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/github/SKILL.md)
- github:yeet: Publish local changes to GitHub by confirming scope, committing intentionally, pushing the branch, and opening a draft PR through the GitHub app from this plugin, with `gh` used only as a fallback where connector coverage is insufficient. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/yeet/SKILL.md)
- linear: Manage issues, projects & team workflows in Linear. Use when the user wants to read, create or updates tickets in Linear. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/linear/SKILL.md)
- pdf: Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)
- playwright: Use when the task requires automating a real browser from the terminal (navigation, form filling, snapshots, screenshots, data extraction, UI-flow debugging) via `playwright-cli` or the bundled wrapper script. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/playwright/SKILL.md)
- spot: HTX Spot trading request using the HTX API. Authentication requires API key and secret key. Supports mainnet. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/spot/SKILL.md)
- spreadsheet: Use when tasks involve creating, editing, analyzing, or formatting spreadsheets (`.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.tsv`) with formula-aware workflows, cached recalculation, and visual review. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/spreadsheet/SKILL.md)
- test-android-apps:android-emulator-qa: Use when validating Android feature flows in an emulator with adb-driven launch, input, UI-tree inspection, screenshots, and logcat capture. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/test-android-apps/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/android-emulator-qa/SKILL.md)
- usdt-m-futures: HTX USDT-M Futures trading using the HTX API. Authentication requires API key and secret key for certain endpoints. Supports mainnet. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/usdt-m-futures/SKILL.md)
- imagegen: Generate or edit raster images when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, or derive visual variants from references, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/imagegen/SKILL.md)
- openai-docs: Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations, help choosing the latest model for a use case, or explicit GPT-5.4 upgrade and prompt-upgrade guidance; prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools, use bundled references only as helper context, and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/openai-docs/SKILL.md)
- plugin-creator: Create and scaffold plugin directories for Codex with a required `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, optional plugin folders/files, and baseline placeholders you can edit before publishing or testing. Use when Codex needs to create a new local plugin, add optional plugin structure, or generate or update repo-root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` entries for plugin ordering and availability metadata. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps. Below is the list of plugins that are enabled and available in this session.
### Available plugins
- `Figma`: Figma workflows for design implementation, Code Connect mappings, and design system rule generation.
- `GitHub`: Inspect repositories, triage pull requests and issues, debug CI, and publish changes through a hybrid GitHub connector and CLI workflow.
- `Test Android Apps`: Test Android apps with emulator workflows for reproduction, screenshots, UI inspection, and log capture.
### How to use plugins
- Discovery: The list above is the plugins available in this session.
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Preference: When a relevant plugin is available, prefer using capabilities associated with that plugin over standalone capabilities that provide similar functionality.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that is not listed above, or the plugin does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

**User**

基于E:\Github\BTCXAU_Monitoring_and_Push_APK\.waylog\history下的历史记录，继续推进下列优化：1、优化点击展开和收起等按钮的流畅动画效果（现在有点卡顿的感觉）；
2、交易记录-排序方式新增功能，重复点击同意选项即倒序排序，如第二次点击平仓时间后，交易记录条目即按照平仓时间倒反向排序。
3、数据获取不要持续多次推送日志，只有在发生特殊事件时（如无法获取数据、新增交易、交易信息变更、新增历史记录等）才推送。
4、目前服务器流量也过高，继续优化。是否可以减少服务器发送的频次（即增加时间间隔）？

Use when implementing UI code from Figma files, when user mentions "implement design", "generate code", "implement component", provides Figma URLs, or asks to build components matching Figma specs. For Figma canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-implement-design/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-use: **MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-use/SKILL.md)
- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that can...", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)
- frontend-skill: Use when the task asks for a visually strong landing page, website, app, prototype, demo, or game UI. This skill enforces restrained composition, image-led hierarchy, cohesive content structure, and tasteful motion while avoiding generic cards, weak branding, and UI clutter. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/frontend-skill/SKILL.md)
- github:gh-address-comments: Address actionable GitHub pull request review feedback. Use when the user wants to inspect unresolved review threads, requested changes, or inline review comments on a PR, then implement selected fixes. Use the GitHub app for PR metadata and flat comment reads, and use the bundled GraphQL script via `gh` whenever thread-level state, resolution status, or inline review context matters. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md)
- github:gh-fix-ci: Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions. Use the GitHub app from this plugin for PR metadata and patch context, and use `gh` for Actions check and log inspection before implementing any approved fix. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md)
- github:github: Triage and orient GitHub repository, pull request, and issue work through the connected GitHub app. Use when the user asks for general GitHub help, wants PR or issue summaries, or needs repository context before choosing a more specific GitHub workflow. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/github/SKILL.md)
- github:yeet: Publish local changes to GitHub by confirming scope, committing intentionally, pushing the branch, and opening a draft PR through the GitHub app from this plugin, with `gh` used only as a fallback where connector coverage is insufficient. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/yeet/SKILL.md)
- linear: Manage issues, projects & team workflows in Linear. Use when the user wants to read, create or updates tickets in Linear. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/linear/SKILL.md)
- pdf: Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)
- playwright: Use when the task requires automating a real browser from the terminal (navigation, form filling, snapshots, screenshots, data extraction, UI-flow debugging) via `playwright-cli` or the bundled wrapper script. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/playwright/SKILL.md)
- spot: HTX Spot trading request using the HTX API. Authentication requires API key and secret key. Supports mainnet. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/spot/SKILL.md)

- usdt-m-futures: HTX USDT-M Futures trading using the HTX API. Authentication requires API key and secret key for certain endpoints. Supports mainnet. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/usdt-m-futures/SKILL.md)
- imagegen: Generate or edit raster images when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, or derive visual variants from references, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/imagegen/SKILL.md)
- openai-docs: Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations, help choosing the latest model for a use case, or explicit GPT-5.4 upgrade and prompt-upgrade guidance; prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools, use bundled references only as helper context, and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/openai-docs/SKILL.md)
- plugin-creator: Create and scaffold plugin directories for Codex with a required `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, optional plugin folders/files, and baseline placeholders you can edit before publishing or testing. Use when Codex needs to create a new local plugin, add optional plugin structure, or generate or update repo-root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` entries for plugin ordering and availability metadata. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps. Below is the list of plugins that are enabled and available in this session.
### Available plugins
- `Figma`: Figma workflows for design implementation, Code Connect mappings, and design system rule generation.
- `GitHub`: Inspect repositories, triage pull requests and issues, debug CI, and publish changes through a hybrid GitHub connector and CLI workflow.
- `Test Android Apps`: Test Android apps with emulator workflows for reproduction, screenshots, UI inspection, and log capture.
### How to use plugins
- Discovery: The list above is the plugins available in this session.
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Preference: When a relevant plugin is available, prefer using capabilities associated with that plugin over standalone capabilities that provide similar functionality.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that is not listed above, or the plugin does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

基于E:\Github\BTCXAU_Monitoring_and_Push_APK\.waylog\history下的历史记录，继续推进下列优化：1、优化点击展开和收起等按钮的流畅动画效果（现在有点卡顿的感觉）；
2、交易记录-排序方式新增功能，重复点击同意选项即倒序排序，如第二次点击平仓时间后，交易记录条目即按照平仓时间倒反向排序。
3、数据获取不要持续多次推送日志，只有在发生特殊事件时（如无法获取数据、新增交易、交易信息变更、新增历史记录等）才推送。
4、目前服务器流量也过高，继续优化。是否可以减少服务器发送的频次（即增加时间间隔）？

<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted. Network access is enabled.
Approval policy is currently never. Do not provide the `sandbox_permissions` for any reason, commands will be rejected.
</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

The `request_user_input` tool is unavailable in Default mode. If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.
</collaboration_mode><skills_instructions>
## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- doc: Use when the task involves reading, creating, or editing `.docx` documents, especially when formatting or layout fidelity matters; prefer `python-docx` plus the bundled `scripts/render_docx.py` for visual checks. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/doc/SKILL.md)
- figma: Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma/SKILL.md)
- figma-code-connect-components: Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md)
- figma-create-design-system-rules: Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md)
- figma-create-new-file: Create a new blank Figma file. Use when the user wants to create a new Figma design or FigJam file, or when you need a new file before calling use_figma. Handles plan resolution via whoami if needed. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard) (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-create-new-file/SKILL.md)
- figma-generate-design: Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, screen, or view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles via search_design_system, imports them, and assembles screens incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-generate-design/SKILL.md)
- figma-generate-library: Build or update a professional-grade design system in Figma from a codebase. Use when the user wants to create variables/tokens, build component libraries, set up theming (light/dark modes), document foundations, or reconcile gaps between code and Figma. This skill teaches WHAT to build and in WHAT ORDER — it complements the `figma-use` skill which teaches HOW to call the Plugin API. Both skills should be loaded together. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-generate-library/SKILL.md)
- figma-implement-design: Translates Figma designs into production-ready application code with 1:1 visual fidelity.

  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps. Below is the list of plugins that are enabled and available in this session.
### Available plugins
- `Figma`: Figma workflows for design implementation, Code Connect mappings, and design system rule generation.
- `GitHub`: Inspect repositories, triage pull requests and issues, debug CI, and publish changes through a hybrid GitHub connector and CLI workflow.
- `Test Android Apps`: Test Android apps with emulator workflows for reproduction, screenshots, UI inspection, and log capture.
### How to use plugins
- Discovery: The list above is the plugins available in this session.
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Preference: When a relevant plugin is available, prefer using capabilities associated with that plugin over standalone capabilities that provide similar functionality.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that is not listed above, or the plugin does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

基于E:\Github\BTCXAU_Monitoring_and_Push_APK\.waylog\history下的历史记录，继续推进下列优化：1、优化点击展开和收起等按钮的流畅动画效果（现在有点卡顿的感觉）；
2、交易记录-排序方式新增功能，重复点击同意选项即倒序排序，如第二次点击平仓时间后，交易记录条目即按照平仓时间倒反向排序。
3、数据获取不要持续多次推送日志，只有在发生特殊事件时（如无法获取数据、新增交易、交易信息变更、新增历史记录等）才推送。
4、目前服务器流量也过高，继续优化。是否可以减少服务器发送的频次（即增加时间间隔）？

<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted. Network access is enabled.
Approval policy is currently never. Do not provide the `sandbox_permissions` for any reason, commands will be rejected.
</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

The `request_user_input` tool is unavailable in Default mode. If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.
</collaboration_mode><skills_instructions>
## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- doc: Use when the task involves reading, creating, or editing `.docx` documents, especially when formatting or layout fidelity matters; prefer `python-docx` plus the bundled `scripts/render_docx.py` for visual checks. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/doc/SKILL.md)
- figma: Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma/SKILL.md)
- figma-code-connect-components: Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md)
- figma-create-design-system-rules: Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md)
- figma-create-new-file: Create a new blank Figma file. Use when the user wants to create a new Figma design or FigJam file, or when you need a new file before calling use_figma. Handles plan resolution via whoami if needed. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard) (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-create-new-file/SKILL.md)
- figma-generate-design: Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, screen, or view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles via search_design_system, imports them, and assembles screens incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-generate-design/SKILL.md)
- figma-generate-library: Build or update a professional-grade design system in Figma from a codebase. Use when the user wants to create variables/tokens, build component libraries, set up theming (light/dark modes), document foundations, or reconcile gaps between code and Figma. This skill teaches WHAT to build and in WHAT ORDER — it complements the `figma-use` skill which teaches HOW to call the Plugin API. Both skills should be loaded together. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-generate-library/SKILL.md)
- figma-implement-design: Translates Figma designs into production-ready application code with 1:1 visual fidelity. Use when implementing UI code from Figma files, when user mentions "implement design", "generate code", "implement component", provides Figma URLs, or asks to build components matching Figma specs. For Figma canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-implement-design/SKILL.md)
- figma-use: **MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/figma-use/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-code-connect-components: Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-create-design-system-rules: Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md)
- figma:figma-create-new-file: Create a new blank Figma file. Use when the user wants to create a new Figma design or FigJam file, or when you need a new file before calling use_figma. Handles plan resolution via whoami if needed. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard) (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/figma/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/figma-create-new-file/SKILL.md)

- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that can...", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)
- frontend-skill: Use when the task asks for a visually strong landing page, website, app, prototype, demo, or game UI. This skill enforces restrained composition, image-led hierarchy, cohesive content structure, and tasteful motion while avoiding generic cards, weak branding, and UI clutter. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/frontend-skill/SKILL.md)
- github:gh-address-comments: Address actionable GitHub pull request review feedback. Use when the user wants to inspect unresolved review threads, requested changes, or inline review comments on a PR, then implement selected fixes. Use the GitHub app for PR metadata and flat comment reads, and use the bundled GraphQL script via `gh` whenever thread-level state, resolution status, or inline review context matters. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md)
- github:gh-fix-ci: Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions. Use the GitHub app from this plugin for PR metadata and patch context, and use `gh` for Actions check and log inspection before implementing any approved fix. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md)
- github:github: Triage and orient GitHub repository, pull request, and issue work through the connected GitHub app. Use when the user asks for general GitHub help, wants PR or issue summaries, or needs repository context before choosing a more specific GitHub workflow. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/github/SKILL.md)
- github:yeet: Publish local changes to GitHub by confirming scope, committing intentionally, pushing the branch, and opening a draft PR through the GitHub app from this plugin, with `gh` used only as a fallback where connector coverage is insufficient. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/github/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/yeet/SKILL.md)
- linear: Manage issues, projects & team workflows in Linear. Use when the user wants to read, create or updates tickets in Linear. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/linear/SKILL.md)
- pdf: Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/pdf/SKILL.md)
- playwright: Use when the task requires automating a real browser from the terminal (navigation, form filling, snapshots, screenshots, data extraction, UI-flow debugging) via `playwright-cli` or the bundled wrapper script. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/playwright/SKILL.md)
- spot: HTX Spot trading request using the HTX API. Authentication requires API key and secret key. Supports mainnet. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/spot/SKILL.md)
- spreadsheet: Use when tasks involve creating, editing, analyzing, or formatting spreadsheets (`.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.tsv`) with formula-aware workflows, cached recalculation, and visual review. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/spreadsheet/SKILL.md)
- test-android-apps:android-emulator-qa: Use when validating Android feature flows in an emulator with adb-driven launch, input, UI-tree inspection, screenshots, and logcat capture. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/test-android-apps/d88301d4694edc6282ca554e97fb8425cbd5a250/skills/android-emulator-qa/SKILL.md)
- usdt-m-futures: HTX USDT-M Futures trading using the HTX API. Authentication requires API key and secret key for certain endpoints. Supports mainnet. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.agents/skills/usdt-m-futures/SKILL.md)
- imagegen: Generate or edit raster images when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, or derive visual variants from references, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/imagegen/SKILL.md)
- openai-docs: Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations, help choosing the latest model for a use case, or explicit GPT-5.4 upgrade and prompt-upgrade guidance; prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools, use bundled references only as helper context, and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/openai-docs/SKILL.md)
- plugin-creator: Create and scaffold plugin directories for Codex with a required `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, optional plugin folders/files, and baseline placeholders you can edit before publishing or testing. Use when Codex needs to create a new local plugin, add optional plugin structure, or generate or update repo-root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` entries for plugin ordering and availability metadata. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/Scott/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

**OpenAI Codex**

<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.
# Escalation Requests

Commands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:

- Pipes: |
- Logical operators: &&, ||
- Command separators: ;
- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)

Each resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.

Example:

git pull | tee output.txt

This is treated as two command segments:

["git", "pull"]

["tee", "output.txt"]

Commands that use more advanced shell features like redirection (>, >>, <), substitutions ($(...), ...), environment variables (FOO=bar), or wildcard patterns (*, ?) will not be evaluated against rules, to limit the scope of what an approved rule allows.

## How to request escalation

IMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:

- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `"require_escalated"`
- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. "Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?"
- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.

If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with "require_escalated". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.

## When to request escalation

While commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:

- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)
- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.
- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.
- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.
- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.

## prefix_rule guidance

When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.

### Banned prefix_rules 
Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes that would allow arbitrary scripting.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. 

### Examples
Good examples of prefixes:
- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
- ["cargo", "test"]


## Approved command prefixes
The following prefix rules have already been approved: - ["C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe", "-Command", "./gradlew.bat assembleDebug"]
- ["C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe", "-Command", "python -m py_compile bridge/mt5_gateway/server_v2.py"]
 The writable roots are `e:\Github\BTCXAU_Monitoring_and_Push_APK`, `e:\Github\BTCXAU_Monitoring_and_Push_APK`.

3、数据获取不要持续多次推送日志，只有在发生特殊事件时（如无法获取数据、新增交易、交易信息变更、新增历史记录等）才推送。
4、目前服务器流量也过高，继续优化。是否可以减少服务器发送的频次（即增加时间间隔）？
